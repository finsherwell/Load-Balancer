Core Improvements

Health checks - Implement active and passive health monitoring to detect failing servers and temporarily remove them from rotation
Weighted load balancing - Allow servers to handle traffic proportional to their capacity
Sticky sessions - Route requests from the same client to the same backend server
Circuit breaker pattern - Automatically stop sending traffic to failing services

Advanced Features

Rate limiting - Protect backend services from being overwhelmed
Metrics collection - Capture performance data (response times, error rates)
API-based configuration - Allow runtime updates without restarting
TLS termination - Handle HTTPS traffic and certificate management

Developer Experience

Plugin architecture - Allow custom modules to be added
Configuration via environment variables and files
Comprehensive logging - Include request tracing and structured logs

Performance Optimisations

Connection pooling - Maintain persistent connections to backend servers
Retries with backoff - Handle transient failures gracefully
Timeout management - Prevent hanging connections
